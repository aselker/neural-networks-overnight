"""
These functions -- some pre-written, some fill-in-the-blanks -- should be almost all you need to write a feedforward neural network.
It won't learn, though.  That's the next section.

A few useful tips:
  * print() everything that you're not sure about.
  * Make sure each function passes its tests before using it.
  * Use "python -i script-name.py" to run the script, and then put you at a Python command line after it's done.  This way, you can look at all of the variables you set and call the functions you wrote.
  * If you really can't figure a function out, and you want a reference implementation, look in feedforward-tests.py.
